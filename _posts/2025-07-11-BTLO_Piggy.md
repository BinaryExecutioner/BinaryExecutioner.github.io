Walkthrough of PIGGY invesigation

### PCAP One: SSH Data Exfiltration

**Question:**  
What remote IP address was used to transfer data over SSH? *(Format: X.X.X.X â€” 3 points)*  
How much data was transferred in total? *(Format: XXXX M â€” 3 points)*

PCAP One is quite largeâ€”over **1GB** in sizeâ€”so I filtered only the **outbound SSH traffic** using the Wireshark filter:

```wireshark
tcp.dstport == 22
```

From there, I navigated to `Statistics > Conversations`, checked **â€œLimit to display filterâ€**, and found the remote IP `35.211.33.16`. The total bytes transferred to this IP from the internal machine was approximately **1123M** â€” a clear indicator of potential data exfiltration over SSH.

### PCAP Two: OSINT-Based Malware Attribution

**Question:**  
Review the IPs the infected system has communicated with. Perform OSINT searches to identify the malware family tied to this infrastructure. *(Format: MalwareName â€” 3 points)*

Here are the IPs observed in the PCAP conversations:

```plaintext
10.0.9.171      â† internal
82.2.64.107
34.110.209.165
188.120.241.27
195.161.41.93
92.53.67.7
31.184.253.37
78.155.206.172
```

Excluding the internal IP, I started investigating the others using tools like **Scamalytics**, **VirusTotal**, and **Google**.

The IP `31.184.253.37` caught my attention. Scamalytics flagged it with a **"Medium Risk"** reputation, and after digging deeper, I found that it had been associated with **Trickbot loader** campaigns in the past.

[Malicious Activity Linked to Trickbot Loader - ANY.RUN](https://any.run/report/387682995c339dd34e1b7943d7bcb84a7c1a3b538ffa10cf5a1555361a40a0fd/c066e0e9-2a69-4927-9d24-11e2888ffbf9#Network)



### PCAP Three: Unusual Ports & Mining Activity

**Question 1:**  
Review the two IPs communicating on unusual ports. What are the two ASN numbers these IPs belong to? *(Format: ASN, ASN â€” 3 points)*

By checking `Statistics > Conversations`, I identified two suspicious external IPs:

- `194.233.171.171`
- `104.236.57.24`

These stood out due to communication over non-standard ports. Using `whois.domaintools.com`, I mapped them to the following ASNs:

- `194.233.171.171` â†’ **AS63949**
- `104.236.57.24` â†’ **AS14061**

**Question 2:**  
What malware category have these IPs been historically linked to? *(Format: MalwareType â€” 3 points)*

VirusTotal analysis revealed that both IPs were previously reported as involved in **cryptocurrency mining**:

- [104.236.57.24 - VirusTotal](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/ip-address/104.236.57.24)
- [194.233.171.171 - VirusTotal](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/ip-address/194.233.171.171)

**Question 3:**  
What ATT&CK technique is most closely related to this activity? *(Format: TXXXX â€” 3 points)*

This behavior corresponds to ATT&CK technique **T1496 â€“ Resource Hijacking**.

> *Adversaries may leverage the resources of co-opted systems to complete resource-intensive tasks such as cryptocurrency mining, which may impact system performance and service availability.*


###  PCAP Four: DNS TXT Queries & C2 Communication

**Question 1:**  
Go to `View > Time Display Format > Seconds Since Beginning of Capture`.  
How long into the capture was the first TXT record query made? *(Format: X.xxxxxx â€” 3 points)*

After switching the time format to **Seconds Since Beginning of Capture**, I applied the display filter:

```wireshark
dns.qry.type == 16
```

This filter isolates DNS TXT record queries â€” often used for exfiltration or C2 signaling.

The first TXT request was observed at:

```
8.527712 seconds
```

**Question 2:**  
Change the display format to `UTC Date and Time of Day`.  
What is the date and timestamp of the first TXT record? *(Format: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS â€” 3 points)*

Switching to UTC format clearly shows the time of the first TXT query:

**Timestamp:**  
(Refer to screenshot below)

**Question 3:**  
What is the ATT&CK subtechnique relating to this activity? *(Format: TXXXX.xxx â€” 1 point)*

This activity â€” where the attacker uses **DNS TXT records for C2 communication** â€” aligns with:

**MITRE ATT&CK:**  
**T1071.004 â€“ Application Layer Protocol: DNS**

Adversaries may communicate using application layer protocols such as DNS to bypass traditional network defenses.
