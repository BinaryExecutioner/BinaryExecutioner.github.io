Hey there! I’m Sidhartha Sunkara, a computer science grad from Manipal University Jaipur, now working as a Threat Hunter at Microsoft. I’ve been in the cybersecurity game for over 5+ years, with experience at places like Arete IR, Trellix (formerly FireEye), K7 Computing, and Security Innovations.

My day-to-day is all about hunting down threats, analyzing malware, reverse engineering, and building detection rules. I’ve worked on a range of cases, from figuring out the tricks behind ransomware attacks to writing Python tools for analyzing malware like Cobalt Strike and Emotet.

I started this blog to share my experiences, tips, and the occasional deep dive into interesting security challenges. If you're into red teaming, malware analysis, or just curious about what goes on behind the scenes in cybersecurity, you might find something here for you.

When I’m not glued to my screen, I’m probably hiking up a mountain trail or diving into an RPG—some of my all-time favorites include Spider-Man, Ghost of Tsushima, and Red Dead Redemption 2. And yep, mountains > beaches, any day!
