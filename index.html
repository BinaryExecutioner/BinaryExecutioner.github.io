    Hey — I’m <strong>Sidhartha Sunkara</strong>, a Threat Hunter at Microsoft. I work across Windows, macOS, and Linux fleets to proactively uncover attacker activity, turn hunting findings into high-fidelity detections, and close gaps before they’re abused. I’m comfortable on both sides of the fence—malware analysis and reverse engineering on one end, detection engineering and large-scale telemetry hunting on the other.
  </p>

  <p>
    Before Microsoft, I spent years in incident response and research roles at Arete IR, Trellix (formerly FireEye), K7 Computing, and NCIIPC. That mix of emergency response, tooling, and research taught me how to pivot fast—from ransomware triage and threat-intel write-ups to building config extractors and writing durable detection content.

  <p>
    I started this site to share practical notes from hunts, walkthroughs, and research. If you’re into red teaming, malware analysis, or the day-to-day of threat hunting, you’ll probably find something useful here. When I’m not buried in logs or IDA, I’m usually on a mountain trail or playing story-driven games like Ghost of Tsushima, Spider-Man, and Red Dead Redemption 2. (Team <strong>mountains &gt; beaches</strong>, every time.)

    You can find more of my work on GitHub at <strong>@BinaryExecutioner</strong> and connect on LinkedIn. If you want to collaborate or chat research, I’m always up for it.
