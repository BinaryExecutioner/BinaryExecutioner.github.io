  <p>
    Hey — I’m <strong>Sidhartha Sunkara</strong>, a Threat Hunter at Microsoft. I work across Windows, macOS, and Linux to surface attacker activity early, turn real behaviors into durable detections, and close gaps before they’re abused. I’m comfortable on both sides of the work: digging into malware and reverse engineering, and building detections and hunts that scale.
  </p>

  <p>
    Before Microsoft, I held security roles at Arete IR, Trellix (formerly FireEye), K7 Computing, and NCIIPC. I spent a lot of time on investigations—triaging intrusions, analyzing malware families, and shipping detection content that actually catches what we see in the wild.
  </p>

  <p>
    I started this site to collect things I've learned—hunt notes, lab walkthroughs, and practical tips. If you're into red teaming, malware analysis, or want a peek at day-to-day threat hunting, you’ll probably find something useful here. When I’m not buried in logs or IDA, I’m usually in the mountains or playing story-driven games like <em>Ghost of Tsushima</em>, <em>Spider-Man</em>, and <em>Red Dead Redemption 2</em>. (Team <strong>mountains &gt; beaches</strong>, always.)
