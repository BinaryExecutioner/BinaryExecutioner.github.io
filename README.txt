How to use these zips

1) Upload the contents of theme_core.zip to your repo, keeping paths:
   - _layouts/default.html
   - assets/css/hacker.css
   - assets/js/matrix.js

2) Then upload the contents of ci_config.zip if you use GitHub Actions:
   - Gemfile
   - _config.yml (either replace yours with the provided one, or copy the 'plugins' and 'exclude' blocks into your existing config)

3) Commit and push. Hard-refresh the site (Ctrl/Cmd+Shift+R).
